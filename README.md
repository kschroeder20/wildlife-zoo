# wildlife-zoo
FInal project for CS 210 using Java and C++ to build a command-line animal management platform.

### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
- We were tasked to build a command-line tool that allowed employees of a zoo to keep track and edit their animal data.

### What did you do particularly well?
- I think that I was able to effectively vaildate most of the user input and keep the program running if there was invalid input.

### Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
- I didn't use smart pointers, which would would have enhanced the memory allocation of my program.
- I also think there is a lot of opportunity to break apart my methods into their own abstract methods to make them smaller.

### Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
- I did find this challenging. I thought that the situation where you had 2 different animal types (Mammal and Oviparous) was tough to deal with because 
they both had unique attributes to their class. To overcome this I basically had to create 2 methods for most of the functions that I wanted my program to do.
One of the functions would handle an instance of the Mammal class and the other would handle an instance of the Oviparous class. Stack Overflow was very useful 
when I had questions.

### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
- I am gaining a deeper understanding for OOP, which is a programming standard that we will undoubtedly use in the future.

### How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
- I used a lot of abstract methods, kept my variable names specific to the data it held, and made the user responses dynamic based on the input type.
